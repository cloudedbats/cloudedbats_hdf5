# CloudedBats - HDF5

This is a part of CloudedBats: http://cloudedbats.org

**Note: Software development is not yet started.**

## hdf54bats

The software library hdf54bats will be used to store data and metadata for bat monitoring projects and surveys. 

When working with large amounts of data it can be stored in the computer memory if it is in the range of Gigabytes of data. For surveys where many detectors are used that's not enough. For Terrabytes of data hard drives and solid state drives (SSD) can be used. Beyond that, when working with Petabytes of data, the solution is to store data in the Cloud. 

HDF5, Hierarchical Data Format, is a file format used to store and access huge amounts of data in an hierarchical manner. In CloudedBats the Python library PyTables will be used to handle the HDF5 storage.
